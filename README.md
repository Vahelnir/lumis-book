# Lumi's Book

A fun experiment where I'm trying re-implement [Lumi_pomme](https://www.twitch.tv/lumi_pomme)'s book.

It's a book, displayed in their stream, that allows them to communicate with the chat since they're not using a microphone.

### Original goals:

- [x] writing text must use a type-writer like animation;
- [x] writing a long message must be properly be split into multiple pages;
- [x] changing page after writing a message must be animated, like a book;
- [x] must be able to infinitly write into the book;
- [ ] must be able to open and close the book (animated)

### Bonuses:

- [x] messages are stored
- [x] we can paginate between pages
- [x] changing (with the pagination) page must be animated
